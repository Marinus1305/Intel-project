<h2>ADVANTAGES OF SOLAR DISTILATION PLANTS</h2>
<p><h3>1) WATER DISTILLED IS SAFE:</h3> It removes impurities such as heavy metals, salts and also eliminates microorganisms.<br>
<br>
<h3>2) THE PH LEVEL OF WATER REMAINS UNCHANGED:</h3> Since the technology uses the principle of natural evaporation and condensation, It allows for natural PH buffering.<br>
<br>
<h3>3) THEY HAVE NO MOVING PARTS:</h3> They are simple and have no parts that move.<br>
<img class="Image21" src="Picture 21.png" alt="Image21" width="300" height="300">
<h3>4) IT IS HIGHLY ECONOMICAL:</h3> It is one of the most economical ways of providing clean, portable water.<br>
<br> 
<h3>5) IT IS RELATIVELY CHEAP:</h3> The maintenance cost after installation is nearly nil.<br>
<br>
<h2>DISADVANTAGES OF SOLAR DISTILATION PLANTS</h2>
<h3>Solar distillation plants have a few drawbacks to it:</h3>

<h3>1) The distilled water obtained removes few of the minerals from the water:</h3> <br>
To tackle this problem, mineral salt depositing containers can be deployed to remineralize the distilled water.<br>
<img class="Image26" src="Picture 26.jpg" alt="Image26" width="300" height="300">
<h3>2) It is completely dependant on the sun:</h3><br> 
In the absence of sunlight, the plant fails to purify water. A few water storage tanks can be keptand a part of the purified water can be stored in those tanks so that in times of shortage these tanks can be used.

<h2>MEANS OF SPREADING AWARENESS</h2>
<h3>1)USING SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES:</h3> Create accounts dedicated for the cause on social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter etc.<br>
<br>
<img class="Image19" src="Picture 19.png" alt="Image19" width="300" height="300" >
<h3>2) SETTING UP FUNDRAISERS:</h3> A carnival can be set up where anyone can participate. All the money earned will go into the project.<br>
<br>
<h3>3)USING THE PRESS:</h3> A story in the local newspaper or TV  news channel will reach a wider, target audience.<br>
<img class="Image20" src="Picture 20.png" alt="Image20" width="300" height="300" >
<h3>4) SETTING UP A GOFUNDME PAGE:</h3>Gofundme pages have no initial costs to pay for setting up a crowd funding event. Anyone interested can partake in the donation drive nation wide.The money made can be used in employing skilled workers for installation of the solar distillation plants as well as its maintenance.

<h2>COSTS INCURRED</h2>
It costs about Rs.48 per sq. cm. to advertise in a newspaper such as “The Times of India”.<br>
<br>
A quarter page advertisement that is 400 sq cm will cost about 20,000Rs.<br>
<img class="Image16" src="Picture 16.png" alt="Image16" width="300" height="300" >
By advertising we ask the readers to donate a small amount. If at least 1000 readers decide to donate 200 Rs. We can put the money earned forward for maintenance or in providing transport for distribution of the purified water.<br>
<br>
<h2>USING ECO-FRIENDLY RICKSHAWS FOR TRANSPORT</h2>
Rikshaws with peddles can be used to transport water to each house .It is an eco-friendly method of transport and can be used to earn extra. It can also provide employment.<br>
<img class="Image17" src="Picture 17.jpg" alt="Image17" width="300" height="300" >
Each can of 20 litre can cost Rs.100. About 20% of the money earned can be used to pay drivers and the rest can be used in maintenance.<br>
